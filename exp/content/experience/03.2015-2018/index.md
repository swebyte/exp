Vincent has worked as a 3D programmer and training programmer, 
where the tasks have involved simulating various machines such as:

* Excavator, Dozer, Articulated Hauler
* Counterbalance Forklift
* Forwarder & Harvester
* Tractor

The exercises were written in LUA & C++ and targeted students in education with support for text-to-speech, session playback, networking, VR and reporting tools. This, combined with the development of Tenstar's "in-house" 3D engine using DirectX11 and Nvidia PhysX.
