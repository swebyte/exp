Vincent acted as project manager and programmer for integration of third-party machine control systems from different companies. As project manager, he oversaw consultants from different countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Denmark and guided the integration of the systems with Tenstar's 3D engine for the simulated machines; Tracked Excavator and Dozer. A machine control system runs on a separate hardware and usually one communicates with it with CAN-bus or Ethernet.

During the years Vincent integrated the following machine control systems:

- Trimble Earthworks, Excavator and Dozer support. Project required participation from Tenstar, Trimble and a consulting firm and the team was spread across the world, which posed challanges with different time zones and deadline for the big german Bauma exhibition.

- Leica's new MCP80, Excavator support. Consultants from Denmark, CAN-bus integration.

- Topcon's 3DMC, upgrade to newer Android based system with an Android tablet.

- Novatron Xsite from Finland, integration was done with both the old hardware and the new Landnova X which could be run directly on the simulator without external hardware.
