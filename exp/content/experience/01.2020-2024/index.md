Vincent was involved in creating a new Development/DevOps team for managing Tenstar's web services and other tools. The role shifted from 3D development to a full focus as a system developer. Here, we developed a completely new suite called Tenstar User Experience that included a new client for the simulator in Node.js, Electron + Angular, as well as a teacher tool in the form of a website in Angular.

The role also involved consulting in IT and hosting of servers and databases. There was room for initiative and it started a spark to driving the company towards a more cloud-based approach.

Services were created such as:
- Handling of analytical data with OpenSearch hosted on Linux using an intermediary app.
- Improved scripts and tools for the build pipeline in Python.
- Hosting of Prometheus & Grafana for server monitoring.
- Development of a major service(s) in Azure for distributing 3D software. Optimized for scalability and faster data download.
