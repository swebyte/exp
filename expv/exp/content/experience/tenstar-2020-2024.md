Vincent was part of creating a new team for managing Tenstar's web services and other tools named "Team Platform & DevOps". The role changed from 3D development to full focus as a system developer. Here we developed a completely new suite called Tenstar User Experience which included a new client for the simulator in Node.js, Electron + Angular and a teacher tool in the form of a web page in Angular named Tenstar Management Tool.

The role also involved IT consulting and hosting of servers and databases. There was room for initiative and they led to driving the company to go more cloud.

Services were created such as:

- Management of analytical data with OpenSearch hosted in Linux with a middle-hand app with HMAC authorization.
- Improved scripts and tools for the build process chain in Python
- Hosting of Prometheus & Grafana for server monitoring
- New development of a larger service(services) in Azure for distribution of the 3D software. Optimized for scaling and faster downloading of data up to 1TB.
